# LondonWeather

London weather is simple weather application that consists of 3 views(tabs). I have also included bonus parts
I have used mainly modular implementation, however in line-chart-component I had to use standalone approach due to chart.js implementation.
Angular Material has been used as UI library.

## Features

- **Feature 1**: Weather table for next 7 days & Historical (date range picker)
- **Feature 2**: Hourly line chart view for previeous screen (chart.js)
- **Feature 3**: Heat Index calculator (with local storage - last 5 results)
